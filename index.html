            <p>
                  I went from being an industrial project manager to a business owner, later closed-up by
                Covid-19. To pivot around that little dilema, I trained on my own and became a licensed mortgage loan officer,
                passing the national test on the first try. I was excited to help people refinance their largest asset 
                to the lowest interest rates seen in generations. While writing up loans remotely, working for a national
                broker, this is where I discovered that there were a ton of bugs and some seriously out-dated software being 
                used in the financial industry. The user interfaces were poorly designed, confusing, and buggy depending on
                the user's browser. Not only was I writing the loan, I was also diagnosing tech issues for customers and correcting
                errors caused by something coming from or pointing to the wrong line of code. Knowing these things could and
                should be fixed, I decided to go back to my first passion (all things computer) and learn how to do just that-build a quick, 
                easy, and straightforward solution to complicated and antiquated web sites. That's what led me to The Ohio State University,
                College of Engineering Boot Camp, where I'm now writing code and learning to create great things!
                
                  And if I'm not coding something, you'll find me relaxing in the Florida Keys with my shelter pups, 
                Willow and Midnight.
